# Reading List

This is a hand-picked collection of interesting books and textbooks I've read at some point. A book made it's way to the list only if I either enjoyed reading majority of it or found it quite beneficial for me. Almost all (if not all) listed books thought me a huge lesson and I can only encourage you to pick any and start reading.

I tried to group them according to some similarities I observed among them. However, since everybody sees different similarities, grouping, in general, is almost never an easy task; and thus, I might not be perfect here.
